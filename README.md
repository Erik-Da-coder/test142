MSG Craft

An [Eaglercraft](https://github.com/LAX1DUDE/eaglercraft) fork

Forked from Eaglecraft, and [ayunami2000](https://github.com/ayunami2000/ayuncraft)

being honest, I'm not good at this, but I will make an attempt to either host a minecraft server and add it to here, or to somehow get singleplayer working via a different project, as it is seperate from this. I may do nothing with this fork, and instead just host.
